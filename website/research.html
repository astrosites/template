			My research is focused the
			  interplay between internal and external
			  factors affecting galaxy evolution
			  between z=1 and today, with the ultimate goal of
			understanding the decline in global
			star-formation activity in the past 10 Gyr.

			<h3>Ultra-Diffuse Galaxies</h3>
			<p>
			A large population of
			extremely extended dwarf galaxies (dubbed
			'Ultra-Diffuse Galaxies,' or UDGs) has been
			identified by recent surveys with high
			sensitivity limits. Understanding the formation of
			these unusual galaxies is compelling, both on
			its own right as well as within the broader context of
			dwarf galaxy fromation and evolution. Although these
			galaxies have been observed both inside and
			outside clusters, UDGs seem to be both more
			abundant and more diffuse in high-density
			environments. Motivated by this observed bias, I am
			currently investigating
			environmentally-motivated UDG formation
			mechanisms using the Bolshoi simulation.
			</p>
			<h3>The UVJ Diagram & the 3D-HST survey</h3>
			<p>
			The location of a galaxy in <it>U-V</it>
			vs. <it>V-J</it> color-color space has proven
			extremely valuable in separating red dusty
			galaxies from red quiescent galaxies,
			particularly at high redshift. The 3D-HST
			survey provides deep spectroscopic follow-up
			of a large number of star-forming and
			quiescent galaxies using the HST grism. These
			observations, in addition to providing a direct
			calibration of the star-formation properties
			of UVJ-classified galaxies, can illuminate the
			how emission line-based properties of high-z
			galaxies compare with their light-weighted
			stellar populations.
			</p>
			  <h3>Satellite Quenching at high
			  redshift</h3>
			<p>
			It is well known that environment plays an
			important role in shutting down
			star formation (or quenching) in dwarf galaxies.
			While many physical mechanisms (e.g. ram-pressure
			stripping, strangulation, starvation...) have been put
			forward to explain this process,
			observational evidence is only beginning to settle the
			question which of these effects are at play in
			low mass (M<sub>*</sub></sub>~10<sup>8</sup>
			M<sub>&odot;</sub>) dwarfs in the local
			universe, and the relative importance of each effect. Observations of
			satellite-quenching in similar dwarfs at high-z provide an
			important piece of our understanding of the
			mechanisms at play during the decline in star-formation.

			  <h3>CO-H<sub>2</sub> Conversion Factor</h3>
			<!--<span class="image image-right"><img
			src="images/cgasphibbsksaco.png" alt=""/></span>--!>
			<p>
			Molecular gas is the principal
			fuel in the star formation process, so understanding the
			molecular gas content of high-redshift
			galaxies goes a long way in building our
			understanding of this process at 
			high-z. A crucial component of
			interpreting observations of molecular gas
			at high-z is the CO-H<sub>2</sub> Conversion
			Factor (&alpha;<sub>CO</sub>) relating the
			observed CO luminosity to the molecular gas
			mass.
			Using data from the <a
			href="http://www.iram-institute.org/EN/content-page-279-7-158-240-279-0.html">
			PHIBSS</a> and <a
			href="http://www.iram-institute.org/EN/content-page-298-7-158-240-298-0.html">
			COLD GASS</a> programs, I have investigated
			the impact of metallicity and density
			on the galaxy-wide &alpha;<sub>CO</sub>
value. My research, which found that &alpha;<sub>CO</sub> values do
not significantly evolve from <it>z</it>=1 to <it>z</it>=0,
demonstrates that molecular gas conditions have not significantly
evolved over the past 8 billion years.
			<!--By comparing the observed CO luminosities
			to the observed star-formation rates, we are
			able to gain insight into the structure of
			star-formation in these galaxies. 
			I am interested in the molecular gas content
			of galaxies and how it influences galaxy evolution.
			The molecular gas content of galaxies is
			primarily studied through emission of carbon
			monoxide (CO). However, the conversion between
			the optically thick CO luminosity and the
			total molecular gas mass
			(&alpha;<sub>CO</sub>) relies on a number of
			assumptions. Because of its importance in
			understanding molecular gas, a full
			understanding of &alpha;<sub>CO</sub> and its
			dependencies is critical for our theory of
			galaxy evolution.
			Using the Kennicutt-Schmidt law, I measure the
			molecular gas content in high-redshift in
			order to study how &alpha;<sub>CO</sub> varies
			with redshift.--!>
