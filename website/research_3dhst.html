				<h2>UVJ Quiescent Galaxies with
			  H&alpha; emission</h2>
			</div>
			
			<h3>Figure 1:</h3>
			<span class="image image-right"><img
			src="images/uvjdiagram.png" alt="Fig. 1"/></span>
			<p>
			The location of our mass and redshift selected galaxies in the UVJ diagram. Quiescent
			systems are shown as red points and star-forming systems are shown as blue
			points. Objects with H&alpha; detections are identified with purple crosses. The box
			outlined by the grey dashed line identifies the region in color-color space used to
			fit for the UVJ dividing line: for each 3D-HST field, and for each redshift bin
			(0.7&le;z&le;1 or 1&lt;z&le;1.5), the minimum of the <it>(U-V) - 0.88&times;(V-J)</it>
			distribution is identified as the UVJ separation line. The dividing lines for the
			low-z selections are shown as grey lines and the dividing lines for the high-z
			selections are shown as green lines. Although most H&alpha;
			detections correspond to star-forming system, 49.7 percent of quiescent objects
			are detected in H&alpha; at &gt;1&sigma;.
			
			</p>

			<h3>Figure 2:</h3>
			<span class="image image-right"><img
			src="images/hamainsequencewithir.png" alt="Fig. 2"/></span>
			<p>
			The location of our sample in the star formation rate-stellar mass plane. Colored
			points plot our sample of quiescent galaxies with H&alpha; emission from the 3D-HST
			catalogs, with circular points corresponding to objects with spatially resolved H&alpha;
			emission and triangular points corresponding to objects with spatially unresolved H&alpha;
			emission. The color of each point corresponds to the UV+IR star formation rate of the
			object. Arrows indicate upper limits of the H&alpha;-based SFRs, again with the color
			indicating the UV+IR SFR. Black contours identify the main sequence of UVJ
			<it>star-forming</it> systems within our sample, and the magenta solid and dashed
			lines show the z=1 main sequence from Whitaker et al. 2014 and the 1&sigma; scatter
			respectively. Black dashed, and dot-dashed lines identify the 3&sigma; completeness
			limits of 3D-HST at z=0.7 and z=1.5 (assuming A<sub>H&alpha;</sub>=0). The population
			of quiescent objects is predominantly made up of systems lying below the main
                        sequence; however some objects, particularly with low masses, lie on or above the main sequence.

			</p>

                        <h3>Figure 3:</h3>
			<span class="image image-right"><img
			src="images/fqwha.png" alt="Fig. 3"/></span>
			<p>
			The fraction of UVJ quiescent objects on or above the main sequence
			(SFR&ge;SFR<sub>Main Sequence</sub>-1&sigma;) as a function of stellar mass. Here, our
			sample is split into two redshift bins 0.7&le;z&le;1.0 and 1.0&lt;z&le;1.5; blue lines
			correspond to objects in the lower redshift bin and green lines correspond to objects
			in the higher redshift bin. Shaded regions correspond to 1&sigma; confidence
			intervals. Solid lines with solid shaded regions are determined from H&alpha;-based
			SFRs, whereas dashed lines and hatched regions are determined using UV+IR SFR. As
			in Figure 2, we are likely missing some low-level, extincted star formation from
			low mass objects, meaning points below 10<sup>9.7</sup>M<sub>&odot;</sub>
			(10<sup>9.2</sup>M<sub>&odot;</sub>) are lower limits for z&gt;1 (z&le;) sample.

                        <h3>Figure 4:</h3>
			<span class="image image-right"><img

			<p>
			<bf>A</bf>: The mean position of quiescent galaxies in the UVJ diagram for both systems
                        with H&alpha; (as purple circles) and without H&alpha; (as red circles) across
                        different bins of stellar mass. The size of the circle corresponds to the number of
                        galaxies in the bin, and the median stellar mass, as well as the fraction of objects
                        with H&alpha; in the stellar mass bin are listed adjacent to each set of
                        circles. Arrows in the bottom right indicate the direction of the psudocolors we use
                        to describe the position of objects in the UVJ diagram, both parallel and
                        perpendicular to the UVJ dividing line ((U-V)+1.14&times;(V-J) and
                        (U-V)-0.88&times;(V-J) respectively). Within nearly all stellar mass bins, the
                        location of quiescent objects with H&alpha; is identical to those without H&alpha;;
                        however, low mass galaxies are more likely to host H&alpha; emission. This point is
                        further illustrated in plot B. <bf>B</bf>: The distribution of perpendicular
                        psudocolors for quiescent objects with (as the solid purple histogram) and without (as
                        the solid red histogram) H&alpha; emission. Also shown as the dashed histogram, the
                        distribution of perpendicular psudocolors for objects with spatially resolved H&alpha;
                        emission. Bold lines with lightly shaded sides delineate the mean and standard
                        deviation on the mean of the perpendicular psudocolors for the distributions. All
                        three distributions are identical (a two-sided KS test yields a p value of 0.12),
                        suggesting that the dividing line we use is effective at identifying objects with
                        colors consistent with an evolved stellar population regardless of the presence of H&alpha; emission.

                        <h3>Figure 5:</h3>
			<span class="image image-right"><img
			src="images/parallelcolorfig.png" alt="Fig. 5"/></span>
			<p>
			<bf>A</bf>: The distribution of the parallel psudocolors of quiescent objects with
                        H&alpha; emission (as the solid purple histogram) and those without H&alpha;
                        emission (as the solid red histogram). Again, the distribution of objects with
                        spatially resolved H&alpha; emission is shown as a dashed purple histogram. As opposed
                        to the distribution of perpendicular psudocolors, the distribution of parallel
                        psudocolors is significantly different for objects with and without H&alpha;
                        emission. In particular, objects with H&alpha; tend to be bluer than objects without
                        H&alpha;, suggesting that galaxies with H&alpha; emission tend to host a younger
                        stellar population than those without H&alpha; emission. <bf>B</bf>: A veronoi diagram
                        illustrating the frequency of H&alpha; emission for regions in stellar mass-parallel
                        psudocolor space, with lighter colors corresponding to regions with a higher
                        occurrence rate of H&alpha; emission (defined as N<sub>with
                        H&alpha;</sub>/N<sub>total</sub>). Black contours correspond the distribution of all
                        quiescent objects in this space, illustrating the strong trend between stellar mass
                        and parallel psudocolor for quiescent objects and the blue and blue and green lines
                        indicate the mean parallel psudocolor at a given mass for objects without H&alpha;, and
                        objects without H&alpha; emission respectively. The position of galaxies on this
                        sequence is largely unaffected by the presence of H&alpha; emission, indicating that
                        the reddening of quiescent galaxies at higher stellar mass occurs in tandem with the
                        decreased frequency of H&alpha; emission.

                        <h3>Figure 6:</h3>
			<span class="image image-right"><img
			src="images/sigmanhistplots_all.png" alt="Fig. 6"/></span>
			<p>
			Structural properties of quiescent galaxies in the 3D-HST survey. Shown in the top
			panel is the distribution of the stellar density within the central 1 kpc
			(&Sigma;<sub>1</sub>). The distribution of quiescent objects with H&alpha; emission is
			discrepant with the distribution of objects with no detected H&alpha; emission (a KS
			test finds a p value of 6&times;10<sup>-5</sup>). The bottom panel illustrates the
			location of quiescent and star-forming systems in the &Sigma;<sub>1</sub>-n
			plane. Blue and red contours show the location of UVJ star-forming and quiescent
			objects respectively and points correspond to objects with spatially resolved
			H&alpha; emission (circles) and unresolved H&alpha; emission (triangles). Color coding
			corresponds to the position of the object along the red sequence as measured by
			(U-V)+1.14(V-J), with lighter colors further along on the red sequence. Quiescent
			objects with H&alpha; appear to be transitioning from a disk-dominated structure to
			a buldge-dominated structure as they move along the red sequence before they become
			completely quenched and elliptical.

                        <h3>Figure 7:</h3>
			<span class="image image-right"><img
			src="images/irxvsmass.png" alt="Fig. 7"/></span>
			<p>
			The dust content of UVJ selected systems, as probed by their infrared excess
                        (IRX=L<sub>IR</sub>/L<sub>1600</sub>). All objects shown have a secure 24 &mu;m
                        detection. Although the dust content of high mass objects is consistent between
                        quiescent and star-forming galaxies, below ~10<sup>10.25</sup>, quiescent objects have
                        higher levels of dust extinction than typical star-forming galaxies. This suggests
                        that some low-mass objects have moved into this space due to very blue intrinsic colors and
                        high levels of extinction.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Figure 8:</h3>
			<span class="image image-right"><img
			src="images/uvjdereddenedwmedian.png" alt="Fig. 8"/></span>
			<p>
			Dust-corrected U-V and V-J colors for the quiescent object in the 3D-HST
			sample. Extinction is either calculated from the infrared excess (for objects with
                        24&mu;m detections), or the best-fitting SED (for objects with no 24&mu;m
			detection). Large points correspond to the median position of objects in this space
			for different mass bins, with the size of the point correlated with the mass of the
			bin. The median position of the entire sample is shown as the large red points, the
			median position of the quiescent objects with H&alpha; emission is shown as the purple
			points. Blue and yellow points correspond to the subsamples with 24&mu;m detections
			and both 24&mu;m and H&alpha; detections respectively. There appears to be population
			of low-mass objects with blue dust-corrected colors that is extincted into UVJ
			quiescent space.
